### Hey there, I'm Dan, a Fullstack Developer originating from Ukraine 👋
---

💻 Currently immersed in captivating projects, I eagerly embrace demanding tasks!

😎 I have a penchant for crafting sophisticated UI systems loaded with data, designing visually appealing interfaces, and staying ahead of the curve with cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, I thrive on architecting robust backend solutions, optimizing application performance, and implementing scalable APIs.

👍 My main tech stack is React.js, Nuxt.js, Express, and TypeScript.

**My latest projects:**

[Multiregnskab](https://www.multiregnskab.dk/en) — the only Danish accounting software that has specific features for holding companies in respect to bookkeeping and annual report.

[Felixhomes](https://www.felixhomes.com/) — a low-commission real estate brokerage serving the greater Nashville area. The tech-friendly approach allows agents to close more deals and charge a lower commission as a result.

[SparrowInvest](https://www.joinsparrow.co/) — a secure platform and community for women to build and share long-term wealth using Bitcoin. It was created to ultimately close the gender investment gap.

[WellnessDetector](http://www.argyle-design.com/) — an admin panel for a non-contact, anonymous, vital sign screening device using state of the art sensors and machine learning to non-invasively determine an individual's state of health. A person's temperature, heart and lung function are measured in real-time, from 1-3 meters away.

[Parentbirth](https://www.parentbirth.com/) — free text-based support for expecting and new parents. Connect with virtual doulas over text message for all your questions on pregnancy, birth, postpartum and new parenthood.

[Rapid Robotics](https://www.rapidrobotics.com/) - the robotics arms operators platform. Wrote the e2e and unit tests with Jest covering the main functionality of the web interface, as well as delivered the new features and enhancements.
